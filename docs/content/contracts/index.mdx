# QuickStart

- This is a simple guide to help you quickly install and use the Solio contract.

## Installation

1. Install the Forge toolchain
  The Solio contract depends on the Foundry Solidity development framework, please install the Forge toolchain according to the Foundry documentation first.

2. Build the Solio core contract
  Once you have completed step 1, you can start installing the Solio contract and its dependencies.

```sh copy
# clone github repository
git clone https://github.com/Solioworld/solio-contracts.git

# pull module dependency
git submodule update --init --recursive

# compile contracts
forge build

# run test templates
forge test
```

## Usage

- Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

```solidity copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "interfaces/IBondingFactory.sol";
import "interfaces/IBondingToken.sol";

function run() public {
    IBondingFactory factory = IBondingFactory(payable(0xAddress));
    IBondingToken token = IBondingToken(payable(0xAddress));

}
```

You can then interact with solio swap using the interface methods provided by the solio contract, the usage of which is explained in detail below.
