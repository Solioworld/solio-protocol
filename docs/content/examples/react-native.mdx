First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ Expo.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your Expo project:

pnpm start
```

## Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your Expo project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
pnpm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
pnpm run ios
```
